Scope and Purpose of the project


We are developing a project for waves on a string simulation. It will be taking input from user dynamically such as moving of an end in a String or inputs from a text-box. The inputs are like Tension, mu of the String, number of Harmonics. As start-ups we don't know what to use. But in my first Prototype I used Html5 (canvas) and JavaScript. We are contributing this project for Mozilla Science Lab.
